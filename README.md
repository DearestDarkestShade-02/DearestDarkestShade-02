- 👋 Hi, I’m @DearestDarkestShade-02
- 👀 I’m interested in helping to work on small game projects requiring story or lore of any sort, as I am a pretty skilled writer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to implement code and better fit stories and ideas within a topic or idea.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mostly games that are under development and need story.
- 📫 How to reach me: 808-292-3305 or vigilgavin7@gmail.com
